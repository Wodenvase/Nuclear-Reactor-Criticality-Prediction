# Nuclear-Reactor-Criticality-Prediction
We will build a machine learning model that acts as a surrogate for the slow physics simulator. It will learn the complex relationship between the reactor's physical parameters and the resulting k_eff. The model will take the reactor design as input and predict k_eff â€‹almost instantly.
