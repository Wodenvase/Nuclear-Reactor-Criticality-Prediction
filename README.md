# AI Surrogate Model for Nuclear Reactor Simulation

This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building an AI-powered surrogate model to instantly predict the criticality (`k_eff`) of a nuclear reactor fuel pin cell. It replaces time-consuming Monte Carlo physics simulations with a high-speed, interactive tool, showcasing a powerful application of machine learning in modern engineering and scientific research.

## Key Features

* **Realistic Data Simulation:** Generates a synthetic dataset based on simplified reactor physics principles, mimicking the output of complex simulators.
* **High-Performance Surrogate Model:** Utilizes an XGBoost Regressor to learn the non-linear relationships between reactor design parameters and criticality, achieving an R² accuracy of over 99%.
* **Interactive "What-If" Dashboard:** A user-friendly interface built with `ipywidgets` allows for real-time "what-if" analysis by simply moving sliders for design parameters.
* **Modular Notebook Structure:** The project is broken down into four clear, sequential Jupyter notebooks, making the workflow easy to follow, understand, and reproduce.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a series of Jupyter Notebooks, each handling a specific part of the workflow. They are designed to be run in order.

1.  **`01_data_simulation.ipynb`**: Explains the key physics parameters and generates a synthetic `reactor_simulations.csv` dataset.
2.  **`02_exploratory_data_analysis.ipynb`**: Loads the dataset, visualizes the relationships between variables, and prepares the data for model training (splitting and scaling).
3.  **`03_model_training.ipynb`**: Trains an XGBoost Regressor, evaluates its performance, visualizes the results, and saves the final model (`xgboost_model.joblib`) and data scaler (`scaler.joblib`).
4.  **`04_interactive_dashboard.ipynb`**: Loads the saved model and scaler to create a real-time, interactive prediction tool.

## Setup and Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ai-reactor-surrogate.git](https://github.com/your-username/ai-reactor-surrogate.git)
    cd ai-reactor-surrogate
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    A `requirements.txt` file is included for easy setup.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
    *Note: If a `requirements.txt` is not available, install the libraries manually:*
    `pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn xgboost matplotlib seaborn jupyterlab ipywidgets`

## How to Run

1.  Launch Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter lab
    ```
2.  Open and run the notebooks sequentially from `01` to `04`. Each notebook builds upon the artifacts created by the previous one.

## Results

The trained XGBoost surrogate model demonstrates exceptional performance on the unseen test data:

* **R-squared (R²):** > 0.998
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** < 0.005

The parity plot below visually confirms the model's high accuracy, with predicted values aligning almost perfectly with the actual simulated values.



The final output is a fast, reliable, and interactive tool that allows users to explore the design space of a reactor pin cell in real-time, a task that would otherwise be computationally prohibitive.
